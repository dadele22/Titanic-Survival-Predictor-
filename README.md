Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 was a catastrophic event, but what if data could reveal hidden patterns in passenger survival rates? Using machine learning, I analyzed Titanic passenger data to uncover trends and predictors of survival.

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Removed irrelevant features (PassengerID, Name, Cabin, Ticket, Embarked)
Replaced missing age values with the dataset mean for normalization

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Boxplots & bar charts revealed that women and children had higher survival rates
Median age of survivors was lower compared to non-survivors

ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Models & Performance
 âœ… Support Vector Machine (SVM) â€“ Achieved 80% accuracy but had difficulty classifying survivors
 âœ… Logistic Regression â€“ Performed at 80% accuracy, showing strong predictive power for passenger fate 
 âœ… Neural Network â€“ Accuracy peaked at 82% with fine-tuned hidden layers, but struggled with false positives

ðŸ”¹ Key Findings 
ðŸš€ Gender and ticket class were the strongest predictors of survival 
ðŸš€ Higher fares correlated with a better survival chance 
ðŸš€ Neural networks provided insight into feature importance, showing sibling presence also influenced survival outcomes

This project showcases machine learning applications in historical analysis, proving that data-driven models can uncover insights even in century-old events
